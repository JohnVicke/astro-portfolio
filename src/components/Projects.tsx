Users can track the number of hours worked, how much is in the "flex account" and get an overview of what you spend most of your time on. Napa also integrates with Google Tasks, allowing users to save, create and stamp their tasks throughout the day.`,

    description: `The name is probably self-explanatory to most people. Snuber is a social media and delivery service aimed at the average snus connoisseur. The idea came about when I was playing video games with my friends and one person called out in a panic that they were out of snus. "It would be so nice if all I'd to do was push a button and someone would deliver it to me!" That's basically the idea behind Snuber. It's a React Native app that lets you send snus distress calls to friends or people near you. When someone delivers snus, they are rewarded with points in the app. Unfortunately, I can't publish it due to tobacco regulations ðŸ”ž.`,
